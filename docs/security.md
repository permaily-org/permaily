# Security model

## What verification proves

That the service answering on the Permaily hosts runs an enclave image built from a specific public commit, and that your TLS connection terminates inside that enclave. It does not prove that the code is correct or free of bugs; it proves that the code you can read is the code that runs.

## Trusted

- **AWS Nitro hardware and hypervisor**, the Nitro Security Module and the AWS Nitro Enclaves root certificate (pinned by fingerprint in `pkg/attestation`).
- **AWS prebuilt enclave kernel, init and nsm.ko** from aws-nitro-enclaves-cli (pinned by hash in `nix/eif.nix`).
- **The source code and its pinned dependencies**: Go modules (`go.sum`, `vendorHash`), npm packages (`bun.lock` and the `node_modules` hash), nixpkgs (`flake.lock`).
- **Let's Encrypt** for issuing certificates to the enclave's key, and the public WebPKI for the verifier's TLS checks.
- In later phases: the LLM provider used for classification (model and prompts are in the image).

## Not trusted

- **The parent EC2 instance and its operator.** It sees only ciphertext and destination hostnames. It can drop, delay or replay traffic, and stop the service; it cannot read or alter content without the verifier detecting it.
- **DNS (Cloudflare) and the network.** A hijacked record points clients elsewhere; the verifier detects it because no other server can present a TLS key bound into a valid attestation.
- **Anything the parent supplies at runtime.** The enclave takes no configuration from the parent; hosts and the ACME directory are compiled into the image.

## Mechanisms

| Threat | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Service runs different code | PCR0-2 in a fresh, AWS-signed attestation must equal the PCRs reproduced from source |
| Debug mode (console access, PCRs zero) | the verifier rejects all-zero PCRs |
| Replay of an old attestation | random 32-byte nonce per verification, 5-minute freshness window |
| TLS terminated outside the enclave (MITM, parent, CDN) | attestation `user_data = sha256(SPKI)` of the certificate on the same connection |
| Certificate for the hosts issued to someone else | detected per connection by the binding above; CAA restricts issuance to Let's Encrypt; F1 adds CAA `accounturi` with an ACME account key sealed by KMS, and CT monitoring |
| Build tampering in CI | anyone can rebuild; CI builds on x86_64 and arm64 and compares; releases carry Sigstore provenance |
| Supply chain of dependencies | all inputs pinned by hash; review dependency changes |

## Known limits (F0)

- The TLS key and ACME account are created at each enclave boot, so each restart issues a new certificate (visible in CT). F1 seals them with KMS.
- The enclave has no persistent state yet.
- Availability is not protected: the operator can always take the service down.
- Metadata visible to the operator: connection timing, sizes, destination hostnames of egress.

## Egress allowlist

The host proxy only tunnels to:

| Destination | Why |
|---|---|
| `acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org:443` | certificate issuance |
| `acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org:443` | test deployments |
